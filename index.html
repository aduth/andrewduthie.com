    <p>Whenever testing code in the context of Node.js comes up in conversation, it’s very likely to be accompanied by an exploration of testing-related tooling and strategies. If you’ve ever participated in such a discussion, it’s not uncommon to hear one or more of the following terms thrown around: test runners, assertion libraries, mocking, stubbing, spying, and continuous integration. While these can certainly be valuable tools to consider as you build out a full test suite, the thought of familiarizing oneself with each can be intimidating to a developer new to the Node.js ecosystem or testing in general.</p>
<p>But you don’t need any of these tools to write a basic test. The idea behind a test is to make an assumption about your code that you’d expect to be true. In cases where these expectations are in fact untrue, the script should abort with a failing exit code. Typically the script is terminated by an uncaught error.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine we have a simple <code>sum</code> function which accepts two arguments where the return value is the sum of the two arguments.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">sum</span><span class="params">( x, y )</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> x + y;
}</code></pre>
<p>Our most basic test might simply consider a summing of two arbitrary numbers for which we’d expect the assumed value to be returned.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="keyword">var</span> calculated = sum( <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">2</span> );

<span class="keyword">if</span> ( calculated !== <span class="number">3</span> ) {
    <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> Error( ‘<span class="number">3</span> was expected, but we saw ‘ + calculated );
}</code></pre>
<p>If we were to run this script, we’d see that it quietly finishes because the summed value is equal to our expected assumption. If we were to tamper with our original <code>sum</code> function by, say, changing the <code>+</code> operator to <code>-</code>, we’d see that it terminates with an uncaught error using the message we specified.</p>
<p>That’s really all there is to basic testing. We could optionally choose to add this as a script in our project&#39;s <code>package.json</code> so that it could be predictably run through the <code>npm test</code> command.</p>
<p>As you continue to build more tests, you&#39;ll want to consider the topics listed in the first paragraph, as they&#39;ll help to extend and simplify common usage patterns. A brief description of each is included below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assertion libraries</strong> define a syntax for declaring your assumptions. Node includes a <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html">core module (<code>assert</code>)</a> which provides a limited assertion syntax.</li>
<li><strong>Test runners</strong> provide a means to combine your tests into a logical grouping, and often provide a reporting interface to more easily interpret the results of your tests.</li>
<li><strong>Mocking, stubbing, and spying</strong> are related topics which allow you to create simulated functions which can then be observed, granting you insight into how your code is executed without the need to actually execute it.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous integration</strong> is a service which will automatically run tasks (including tests) when the code is changed.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="blog-body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> is a JavaScript task runner that helps automate common development tasks such as minifying and testing code. Traditionally, using Grunt is a two-step process. First you install Grunt&#39;s command-line interface (GLI) globally using npm (<code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code>). Next, in any project where Grunt is to be used, you must locally install Grunt and any Grunt plugins you wish to include. The command-line interface is installed separately so as to allow multiple versions of Grunt to be installed on the same machine, and acts as a simple wrapper for executing tasks through the local Grunt module.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve installed Grunt both locally and globally, and after <a href="http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks">configuring your Gruntfile</a>, running a task is as simple as passing a task name to Grunt&#39;s command-line interface. For example, if my Gruntfile defines a <code>test</code> task, I could run it by entering <code>grunt test</code> into my command-line. It may sometimes be necessary or handy to be able to trigger a task without the Grunt CLI, in which case you can use the following code snippet, replacing <code>test</code> with the task(s) of your choosing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">node <span class="operator">-e</span> <span class="string">"require('grunt').tasks(['test']);"</span></code></pre>
<p>There are a few common scenarios in which using the above syntax would be preferable to running tasks through Grunt directly. Specifically, this may be a requirement in cases where another developer or system does not have Grunt installed globally.</p>
<p>As an illustration, consider the <a href="https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html"><code>scripts</code> feature</a> of npm. Often overlooked, the <code>scripts</code> section of a <code>package.json</code> allows a developer to define command-line scripts to be run via predefined keywords. For example, you could trigger a Grunt <code>test</code> task with the following configuration, to be called using <code>npm test</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
 "<span class="attribute">name</span>": <span class="value"><span class="string">"my-package"</span></span>,
 "<span class="attribute">version</span>": <span class="value"><span class="string">"1.0.0"</span></span>,
 "<span class="attribute">scripts</span>": <span class="value">{
  "<span class="attribute">test</span>": <span class="value"><span class="string">"node -e \"require('grunt').tasks(['test']);\""</span>
 </span>}
</span>}</code></pre>
<p>The advantage of using the command above in place of <code>grunt test</code> is that your <code>test</code> script can now be executed regardless of whether the global Grunt module is installed.</p>
<p>Removing global dependencies may also help in the case of continuous integration services. Personally, I use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> to run unit tests against my GitHub project commits. Up until recently, I&#39;ve used the <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#before_script%2C-after_script"><code>before_script</code> section</a> of my <code>.travis.yml</code> configurations to install the global Grunt module. By running my tasks directly, I can safely omit this configuration section. Other services may not even grant you the option to configure global dependencies, so this may be your only option.</p>
<p>And it&#39;s not just Grunt, either. Where possible, make an effort to eliminate the need for global dependencies in your npm scripts. Not every developer is going to be familiar with the tools that you choose to use, and removing such dependencies helps to avoid frustration caused by error messages. It may someday be possible to define global dependencies in a project&#39;s <code>package.json</code>, but <a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2949#issuecomment-11408461">that&#39;s not likely to be coming anytime soon</a>.</p>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div class="blog-body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Recently, I&#39;ve been toying with JavaScript&#39;s <code>setInterval</code> method which, if you&#39;re unfamiliar, allows you to execute code repeatedly at a specified time interval. For example, one might create an interval which executes every second by using the following code snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">setInterval(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
    console.log(<span class="string">'I execute every second!'</span>);
}, <span class="number">1000</span>);</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>setInterval</code> and its close cousin <code>setTimeout</code> suffer from latency caused by JavaScript&#39;s single-threaded nature. While you may intend for an interval to execute every 1000 milliseconds, in reality it could take slightly longer for the function to be triggered. This is typically only a few milliseconds and therefore might appear to be a negligible problem. You might also expect that subsequent intervals would make an effort to get the code execution back on a predictable schedule. In other words, if there was 1007 milliseconds between registering the interval and the first code execution (a delay of 7 milliseconds), you could expect the next execution to occur as close to 2000 milliseconds as possible (i.e. 993 milliseconds later).</p>
<p>Depending on your browser, however, this may not be the case. We can demonstrate this by tracking the number of milliseconds which have passed since <code>setInterval</code> was registered:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> startTime = Date.now();
setInterval(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
  console.log((Date.now() - startTime) + <span class="string">'ms elapsed'</span>);
}, <span class="number">1000</span>);</code></pre>
<p>If you run this in current versions of Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, or Node.js, you&#39;ll notice that the interval execution grows increasingly out of sync with the original <code>setInterval</code> function call.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/post/setinterval/setInterval.png" alt="setInterval increasingly grows out of sync"></p>
<p>In my testing, I&#39;ve found that only Firefox attempts to keep the interval execution in sync.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this is the intended behavior of <code>setInterval</code>, I needed a means by which I could execute code as closely as possible to a predictable interval. Below is my solution to this problem:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">window.setCorrectingInterval = (<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(func, delay)</span> {</span>
  <span class="keyword">var</span> instance = { };

  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">tick</span><span class="params">(func, delay)</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> (!instance.started) {
      instance.func = func;
      instance.delay = delay;
      instance.startTime = <span class="keyword">new</span> Date().valueOf();
      instance.target = delay;
      instance.started = <span class="literal">true</span>;

      setTimeout(tick, delay);
    } <span class="keyword">else</span> {
      <span class="keyword">var</span> elapsed = <span class="keyword">new</span> Date().valueOf() - instance.startTime,
        adjust = instance.target - elapsed;

      instance.func();
      instance.target += instance.delay;

      setTimeout(tick, instance.delay + adjust);
    }
  };

  <span class="keyword">return</span> tick(func, delay);
});</code></pre>
<p>Including the code sample above will add a new <code>setCorrectingInterval</code> function to the <code>window</code> global that can be called using the same parameters you would normally pass to <code>setInterval</code>. Here&#39;s a detailed breakdown of what&#39;s going on in the new function:</p>
<ul>
<li>To track properties related to this particular interval instance, we wrap the inner <code>tick</code> function inside a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Closures">closure</a> construct.</li>
<li>When the function is first called (i.e. when <code>instance.started</code> is <code>false</code>), a number of properties are stored to our <code>instance</code> object.</li>
<li>In place of <code>setInterval</code>, we repeatedly call <code>setTimeout</code>, passing the <code>tick</code> function and an adjusted delay.</li>
<li>The adjusted delay is calculated by tracking both the start time of the original function call and an incremented target execution time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To achieve the desired behavior, we can update the broken example to use <code>setCorrectingInterval</code> in place of <code>setInterval</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> startTime = Date.now();
setCorrectingInterval(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
  console.log((Date.now() - startTime) + <span class="string">'ms elapsed'</span>);
}, <span class="number">1000</span>);</code></pre>
<p>As can be seen in the image below, the number of milliseconds elapsed does not continuously increase, but instead aims to occur as closely as possible to the intended once-per-second schedule.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/img/post/setinterval/setCorrectingInterval.png" alt="setCorrectingInterval adjusts to stay in sync"></p>
<p><em>If you find this useful, I&#39;ve created a more full-featured version, which includes a matching <code>clearCorrectingInterval</code> and adds the option to pass arguments (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.setInterval">refer to setInterval&#39;s method signature for more information</a>). You can read more about it, including download instructions, <a href="https://github.com/aduth/correctingInterval">on the GitHub repository</a>.</em></p>

  <div class="blog-body" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> is a JavaScript utility for module loading and dependency management. It enables you to keep independent modules in separate files, and automatically loads the defined dependencies between them. This gives the notion of an &quot;import&quot; and, in theory, leads to more maintainable JavaScript.</p>
<p>Modules can be thought of simply as blocks of code executed under the context of the namespace in which it is defined. By default, this is the filename without the extension. In the example below, calling <code>define</code> in the <em>dinner.js</em> script will create the dinner module. The return value of a module can be used by any other code which depends upon it.</p>
<p>It is important to note that keeping the JavaScript files separated will negatively impact your page load speed. With a RequireJS workflow, you will want to use an optimization tool (r.js) during your production deployment process to concatenate and minify your code to a single, small file. You can read more about this in the &quot;Further Reading&quot; section below.</p>
<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at a very simple example of RequireJS in a web application.</p>
<p>Imagine we have the following project structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>js/<ul>
<li>main.js</li>
<li>dinner.js</li>
<li>meat.js</li>
<li>potatoes.js</li>
<li>require.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will want to start by adding a script tag to our main page to load the RequireJS library. We will also specify an entry point through the <code>data-main</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml"><span class="doctype">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">head</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">title</span>&gt;</span>My Dinner Example<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">title</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">head</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">body</span>&gt;</span>
    Total meal calories: <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">span</span> <span class="attribute">id</span>=<span class="value">"lblCalories"</span>&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">span</span>&gt;</span>

    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="title">script</span> <span class="attribute">data-main</span>=<span class="value">"js/main"</span> <span class="attribute">src</span>=<span class="value">"js/require.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="javascript"></span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">script</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">body</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="title">html</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>This entry point will load the <em>js/main.js</em> script automatically. From our RequireJS scripts, we can either <code>define</code> a new module or use <code>require</code> to load dependencies without defining a new module. In either case, loading dependencies is done using the function call, as seen below in <em>dinner.js</em> and <em>main.js</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="comment">// meat.js (potatoes.js would be nearly identical)</span>
<span class="comment">// Define a new module named "meat"</span>
define(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> {
        calories: <span class="number">350</span>
    };
});</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="comment">// dinner.js</span>
<span class="comment">// Define a new module named "dinner"</span>
define([ <span class="string">'meat'</span>, <span class="string">'potatoes'</span> ],
<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(meat, potatoes)</span> {</span>
    <span class="comment">// Do something using meat and potatoes</span>
    <span class="keyword">return</span> {
        totalCalories: meat.calories + potatoes.calories
    };
});</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="comment">// main.js</span>
<span class="comment">// Load the dinner module</span>
require([ <span class="string">'dinner'</span> ],
<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(dinner)</span> {</span>
    document.getElementById(<span class="string">'lblCalories'</span>).innerHTML = dinner.totalCalories;
});</code></pre>
<p>To load other modules as dependencies, pass an array as the first parameter with a series of modules to load. In the main script, loading &#39;dinner&#39; will call the <em>dinner.js</em> file, which returns an object containing the <code>totalCalories</code> property. Since our meat and potato modules do not depend on anything else, we can omit the first parameter. In the main script, I use <code>require</code> because I want to depend on modules, but I do not want to have main itself be used as a dependency elsewhere. Use the <code>define</code> method instead when defining a module. By default, the module name takes the name file minus the extension, so you should only define a single module per file.</p>
<p>There are several ways to call the <code>define</code> and <code>require</code> methods, including the option to specify a custom module name. To learn more, read the <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#define">API documentation for define</a>.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>
<p>For a more thorough walkthrough of RequireJS, read through the <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html">API documentation</a>. For instructions on how to concatenate and minify your RequireJS projects, refer to the <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html">optimization instructions</a>. To simplify the build process, you may find that using a tool like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt.js</a> can be very helpful.</p>
<p>RequireJS is extensible, so there are a variety of plugins you can use to extend the capabilities of the module loader. For example, if you want to load CoffeeScript, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/jrburke/require-cs">require-cs</a> plugin. If you use a templating library like mustache.js, you can use the  <a href="https://github.com/requirejs/text">text.js</a> plugin to load static text resources to avoid writing your templates as JavaScript strings or between <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<p>To see how RequireJS is used in an existing project, check out my <a href="https://github.com/aduth/Toupee">&quot;Toupée&quot; project on GitHub</a>, which uses RequireJS with Backbone.js.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>RequireJS removes the guess work from dependency management, meaning you can worry less about the order your scripts are loaded and where you define your functions. By separating your modules into separate files, you create a separation of concerns and avoid the possibility that your application&#39;s main script grows too large to manage.</p>

    <p>As web developers, we most often work with dynamic web content. These days, it&#39;s rare to come in contact with plain old HTML files. That said, there are a growing number of tools which assist in the creation of static sites, aptly named <em>static site generators</em>. To cite a recent example, Kyle Rush <a href="http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/">published an article</a> explaining how Obama&#39;s campaign team used Jekyll, arguably the most popular static site generator, to improve the performance of their $250 million fundraising platform. In this article, I will discuss the purpose of these tools, the benefits they provide, and several popular options to choose from.</p>
<h2 id="an-overview">An overview</h2>
<p>For a simple site or blog, it is not uncommon to create a basic web application consisting of two primary components: (1) a page layout (i.e. header and footer), and (2) a small collection of database tables to manage content. There really isn&#39;t a whole lot going on here, and the whole application server + database + hosting solution can become a real pain for such a simple project. If the goal is to simply wrap written content within the context of a master layout, this is hardly the simplest solution.</p>
<p>Static site generators are able to satisfy the same needs without the unnecessary complexity. As part of the build process, layouts are combined with content to generate simple HTML files. Layouts are likely to have some variation of a templating syntax, and content files can be written in Markdown or other familiar writing formats. As a result, you avoid the headache of the overhead which can accompany dynamic sites.</p>
<h2 id="primary-benefits">Primary benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast</strong>: Because the generated files are simple HTML files, they can be served directly rather than being processed by an application server.</li>
<li><strong>Affordable</strong>: There are several options to host your static sites <em>for free</em>. For example, you could store the files in a simple Dropbox folder, and use a service like <a href="http://www.site44.com/">site44</a> to serve them from a custom domain. You can also serve a static site directly from a GitHub repository using  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages">these instructions</a>. For a more sturdy hosting solution, Amazon offers their <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> at a very affordable price for most sites.</li>
<li><strong>Simple</strong>: Most static site generators require a layout, some content, and a basic understanding of the syntax used to link them together. Jekyll uses Ruby, but you won&#39;t need to know much about Ruby in order to use it for your own sites.</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>: Because your site is simple HTML, there&#39;s significantly fewer security risks. As a result, you can concentrate on what really matters: the content itself.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This blog itself is maintained using a custom static site generator. It&#39;s fairly basic, but the source code is available at the <a href="https://github.com/aduth/andrewduthie.com">GitHub repository</a> in case you&#39;re curious about the project structure of a simple static site. Since this is a custom generator, it may be more relevant to refer to the source of some of the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites">many sites which use Jekyll</a>.</p>

    <p>To be a resourceful developer, it&#39;s important to keep up with new trends and current best practices to be applied in our own projects. Below, I share my current resources I use to find new projects, ideas, and discussions.</p>
<h2 id="blogs">Blogs</h2>
<p>Blogs allow industry experts and other enthusiasts to share their knowledge on a topic that interests them. Many times, this is an exploration of a topic that tends to cause trouble for many developers. Other times, authors simply want to share some of their own guidelines and practices.</p>
<p>Here are some of the blogs I follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding Horror</a> (Jeff Atwood)</li>
<li><a href="http://sachagreif.com/">Sacha Greif</a></li>
<li><a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS Tricks</a> (Chris Coyier)</li>
<li><a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/">Ian Storm Taylor</a></li>
<li><a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/">Addy Osmani</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Online magazines offer articles from a variety of authors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A RSS reader may come in handy for keeping track of new posts. I personally use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon">Feeder</a> extension for Chrome.</p>
<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
<p>Blogs are usually most useful for in-depth discussions of focussed subjects. On the other hand, tweets are forced to be more concise, hence tend to be impulsive. A tweet can include an interesting tool or article the author has found intriguing.</p>
<p>Blog authors and industry experts are a good starting point for people to follow. From there, Twitter will periodically recommend others with similar expertise that you may be interested in reading.</p>
<p>In order to keep up with tweets, I use the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ikknnkomiokeodcdkknnhgjmncfiefmn">Twitter Notifier</a> extension for Chrome, which provides desktop notifications for new tweets.</p>
<h2 id="social-news-hacker-news-others-">Social News (Hacker News, others)</h2>
<p>The idea of social news is to implement a democratic-style voting system to article submissions. Not only are the articles themselves useful for learning, but I find that the comments invite a variety of perspectives in the form of reactions, criticism, and further reading.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to find a social news site which appeals to your interests. <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> was originally targeted towards startup entrepreneurs, but has invited discussion of tech news and development practices more generally. If you want a more targeted discussion group, Reddit&#39;s many sub-reddits may be more relevant. Some of the more popular sub-reddits include <a href="http://reddit.com/r/webdev">/r/webdev/</a> for web development, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/javascript">/r/javascript/</a> for javascript, or <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming">/r/programming/</a> for programming in general.</p>
<h2 id="presentations-screencasts">Presentations &amp; Screencasts</h2>
<p>Throughout the year, there are numerous technology conferences which developers can attend to refine their skills. While it&#39;s not always possible to attend these conferences, we&#39;re fortunate that many speakers and conference organizers upload their presentations for the general public to consume. Each of these presentations provides an expert&#39;s concise summary of a broad topic, so is helpful in attaining a minimal understanding.</p>
<p>Addy Osmani recently shared a curated list of talks for front-end engineering at Smashing Magazine (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/22/talks-to-help-you-become-a-better-front-end-engineer-in-2013/">link</a>). Smashing Magazine itself recently held its own conference, of which many videos are now <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/07/the-smashing-conference-exclusive-videos-interviews/">available online</a>. For a more general resource, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/">Speaker Deck</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> are platforms which allows speakers to share their presentations online.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are my own sources which I find useful. If you are aware of other useful resources and want to share, feel free to get in touch with me directly or leave a comment.</p>
