Tonight, I presented on the topic of "Responsive Web" to our [local WordPress meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Cincinnati-WordPress-Meetup/) based in Cincinnati. Below is the abstract and slides:

> What is responsive web design, and why should you care? As a developer or when otherwise modifying an existing theme, how do you go about making elements on a page responsive? At December's meeting, we'll seek to answer these questions and others.
>
> Some items that we'll expect to cover include:
>
> - Motivations behind responsive web design
> - Tools for testing your a theme or page in a variety of contexts
> - Building your site to work on all types of displays, be it desktop, phone, tablet, or other
